It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/).\n\nYou can learn more on http://prismjs.com/.\n\nWhy another syntax highlighter?: http://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841\n\n## Contribute to Prism!\n\nPrism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, considering giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:\n\n- Read the [documentation](http://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism was designed to be extensible.\n- Do not edit `prism.js`, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the components/ folder. The minified files are also generated automatically.\n- The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify the files and build `prism.js`. Having gulp installed, you just need to run the command `gulp`.\n- Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/). Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.\n- Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes I want to merge and changes I don't, handling it becomes difficult.\n- My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review longer PRs (short ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected.\n- If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.\n- If you add a new language definition, theme or plugin, you need to add it to `components.js` as well, so that it becomes available to the download build page.\n\nThank you so much for contributing!!\n","maintainers":[{"name":"charleshansen","email":"chansen87@gmail.com"},{"name":"leaverou","email":"lea@verou.me"},{"name":"rdy","email":"ryan.dy@gmail.com"},{"name":"vinsonchuong","email":"vinsonchuong@gmail.com"},{"name":"stubbornella","email":"nicole@stubbornella.org"},{"name":"gpleiss","email":"gpleiss@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-07T01:45:09.291Z","created":"2015-05-12T23:54:40.643Z","9000.0.1":"2015-05-12T23:54:40.643Z","9000.0.2":"2015-05-12T23:56:14.033Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-13T00:37:38.541Z","1.1.0":"2015-10-06T00:03:04.995Z","1.2.0":"2015-10-07T17:35:20.776Z","1.3.0":"2015-10-27T02:35:27.738Z","1.4.1":"2016-02-05T03:02:10.903Z","1.5.0":"2016-05-16T19:27:36.144Z","1.5.1":"2016-06-07T01:45:09.291Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism","keywords":["prism","highlight"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism.git"},"author":{"name":"Lea Verou"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"jacoborus":true,"rexpan":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"57562725-3a27\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 07 Jun 2016 01:45:09 GMT"}
